  * Unified asynchronous API for use with greenlets or threads
  * Lock, Party, Election, and Partitioner recipe implementations (more
    implementations are in development)
  * Data and Children Watchers
  * Integrated testing helpers for Zookeeper clusters
  * Simplified Zookeeper connection state tracking
  * Pure-Python based implementation of the wire protocol, avoiding all the
    memory leaks, lacking features, and debugging madness of the C library
 .
 Kazoo is heavily inspired by Netflix Curator simplifications and helpers.
