        Almost all async-result objects are created by a method that is
        invoked from the user's thead. The one exception I'm aware of is
        in the PatientChildrenWatch utility, that creates an async-result
        in its worker thread. Just because of that it is imperative to
        only create asyncio compatible results when the invoking code is
        from the loop's thread. There is no PEP/API guarantee that
        implementing the create_future() has to be thread-safe. The default
        is mostly thread-safe. The only thing that may get synchronization
        issue is a debug-feature for asyncio development. Quickly looking at
        the alternate implementation of uvloop, they use the default Future
        implementation, so no change there.
        For now, just to be safe, we check the current thread and create an
        async-result object based on the invoking thread's identity.
