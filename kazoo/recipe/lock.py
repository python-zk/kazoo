"""Zookeeper Locking Implementations

Error Handling
==============

It's highly recommended to add a state listener with
:meth:`~KazooClient.add_listener` and watch for
:attr:`~KazooState.LOST` and :attr:`~KazooState.SUSPENDED` state
changes and re-act appropriately. In the event that a
:attr:`~KazooState.LOST` state occurs, its certain that the lock
and/or the lease has been lost.
